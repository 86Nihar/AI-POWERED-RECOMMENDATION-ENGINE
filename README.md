This project is a simple but functional movie recommendation system built using Python. The backend is powered by Flask and uses machine learning techniques (specifically, collaborative filtering with cosine similarity) to suggest movies to users based on their previous ratings.

The core idea is to analyze how users rate different movies and find patterns in those ratings. By calculating the similarity between movies, the engine can predict what a user might like next—even if they've never rated those movies before.

Once the model is built, the recommendations are made accessible through a clean, RESTful API. This allows other applications (like a frontend or mobile app) to easily integrate and fetch personalized movie suggestions by sending simple HTTP requests.

The API is lightweight, easy to understand, and designed to be extendable. It’s a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn the basics of building machine learning-powered services and exposing them over the web.
